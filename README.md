# Zorban (Practice)

A very simple practice of a multiroom messaging app made with Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, Express.js and Socket.io.

## Running the project

To run the project (client and server) just run the following (I did it under node 19.1.0):

```bash
npm install
```

and then run 

```bash
npx lerna run dev
```

then you'll see the host to access the app, e.g., `http://localhost:5173/`.
